    <h1>Gold Prices Hit Record Amid Global Uncertainty</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>
    Gold has surged to a record high, reflecting strong demand as global economic uncertainty continues to push investors toward safer assets. The spot price reached $3,508.50 per ounce, extending a climb of nearly one-third since the start of the year.
  </p>

  <p>
    Analysts note that the metal’s appeal has been boosted by expectations of lower interest rates, which reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold. Concerns over long-term financial stability and rising volatility in global markets have also driven renewed interest in the precious metal.
  </p>

  <p>
    Typically, surging prices dampen demand from jewellery buyers, yet investment products such as bars and coins remain highly sought after. This signals that gold is attracting both traditional investors and retail buyers seeking security in uncertain times.
  </p>

  <p>
    Experts emphasize that the rally is not driven by one factor alone but by a combination of shifting trade policies, inflationary pressures, and broader political risks. With ongoing volatility in financial markets, gold’s status as a reliable store of value appears more entrenched than ever.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rise suggests that safe-haven demand could remain elevated, particularly if global instability persists and monetary policies continue to shift in ways that unsettle investors.
