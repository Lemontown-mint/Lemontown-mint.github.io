    <h1>The Struggle for Workplace Gender Equality</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
     <p>
    Women have made notable strides, advancing into leadership roles in government, finance, and science. Trailblazers in these fields reflect how opportunities have widened, yet significant gaps remain.
  </p>

  <p>
    Despite strong achievements in education, women continue to face barriers in health, economic participation, and political representation. They hold only about one-fifth of board seats, despite making up nearly half of entry-level jobs. 
  </p>

  <p>
    In the public sector, women have surpassed representation targets in top posts, but private firms continue to lag behind. Experts stress the need for mandatory gender diversity disclosures, quotas, and mentorship programmes to accelerate change.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pay inequality also persists, with women consistently earning less than men. Stereotypes, caregiving responsibilities, and promotion biases deepen this gap, particularly disadvantaging mothers. Advocates highlight the need for stronger parental leave policies, anti-discrimination laws, and reforms to ensure equal access in hiring, pay, and career advancement.
  </p>

  <p>
    Education is also seen as critical to shifting attitudes. Reforms that highlight women’s achievements and challenge stereotypes can help instil respect and equality from an early age. As one expert notes, slogans alone are insufficient; lasting change requires transforming mindsets as well as policies.
