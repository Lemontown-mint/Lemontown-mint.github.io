    <h1>Three to Five Cups Coffee Boost Health</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
   <p>
    A recent review suggests that drinking three to five cups of coffee daily is linked to longer life and reduced risk of major diseases, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, dementia, and certain cancers.
  </p>

  <p>
    For most adults, moderate coffee consumption appears both safe and beneficial. Plain coffee is naturally low in calories, and multiple studies show reduced mortality among regular drinkers. One large analysis found the lowest risk at about three and a half cups per day, with both decaf and caffeinated coffee showing similar benefits.
  </p>

  <p>
    Research highlights include a 10–15% reduction in overall mortality, a 15% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, and protection against cognitive decline, Parkinson’s, and some respiratory conditions. Coffee may also reduce risks of depression and falls, while offering modest benefits for liver and kidney health.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, the review notes potential caveats. Excessive consumption may cause anxiety, sleep issues, or palpitations, and pregnant women are advised to limit caffeine. Additives such as sugar may reduce protective effects, though small amounts of cream or milk substitutes show little harm.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, evidence suggests that coffee, particularly when consumed black or lightly sweetened, offers more health benefits than risks, supporting its role in longevity and disease prevention.
